          <p>
            I am a UCLA Mechanical Engineering student focused on the full engineering loop: defining the problem,
            designing the system, validating the idea, manufacturing the hardware, and learning from testing. I am drawn
            to work where analytical engineering and hands-on execution meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience spans Formula SAE suspension design, aerospace manufacturing support systems, MEMS hardware,
            biomedical fluid-flow research, robotics, and 3D printed product development. Across these projects, I care
            most about building things that are useful, manufacturable, testable, and thoughtfully engineered.
